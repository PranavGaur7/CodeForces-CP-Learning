## 👋 About This Repository

Welcome! This repository is a personal collection of my solutions to various problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), a platform for competitive programming. I created this repository to track my progress, document my solutions, and share my approaches with the community.

The main purpose of this project is to:
* Serve as a personal log of my journey in competitive programming.
* Practice implementing various algorithms and data structures.
* Revisit my solutions to learn from past mistakes and discover better techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by their **Contest ID** and **Problem Letter**. This structure makes it easy to find a specific problem solution.

```

.
└──  contests/
├── 1703/
│   ├── A/
│   │   ├── solution.cpp
│   │   └── README.md (optional: problem statement/notes)
│   ├── B/
│   │   └── solution.cpp
│   └── ...
└── 1692/
├── A/
│   └── solution.py
└── ...

```

* There will be files for each solution
* Each directory under `contests/` is named after the contest ID.
* Inside each contest directory, there's a subdirectory for each problem solved (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`).
* The source code file (e.g., `solution.cpp`, `solution.py`) contains the solution for that problem.

## 💻 Languages & Tools

The majority of the solutions are written in **C++**, but you may also find solutions in other languages.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Navigate to the `contests/` directory.
2.  Find the directory corresponding to the contest you're interested in.
3.  Open the folder for the specific problem to view the solution file.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is primarily a personal repository, but I'm open to suggestions and discussions. If you have a more optimal solution, a different approach, or find a bug in my code, feel free to open an **Issue**. I'd love to learn from you!

## 📝 Disclaimer

The solutions here are for educational and practice purposes. They represent my approach at the time of solving and may not always be the most efficient or elegant solution. Always try to solve the problems on your own first!
